#Stigmergie

This is me trying to make a multi agent system reproducing ants behaviour.
Ants (red points) are randomly looking for food (blue points), once food have been found by an ant, it leave a pheromonal track followed by other ants.
Currently giving bad results.
Comments and code are in French.
